# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS USING R

The Analysis is done as a part of assignment for the course Data Analysis, and Mathematical algorithms at Conestoga College. The study file was
created based on data sets available from Elections Canada and augmented with data from Local Parliament Project(LPP2015). There are 338 electoral
districts in Canada, and each with several candidates for different parties. The analysis is focussed on Liberal Party and Trudeau as a party candidate.
The code has different techniques of summarizing and visualizing the data.

## Techniques used for Descriptive and Exploratoy Analysis

* Summary tables
* Bar chart
* Histogram
* Box plots
* Scatter plots

### Prerequisites
